# Introduction

## Rationale 

Within the [COST Action FP1304 PROFOUND](http://cost-profound.eu/site/), we are developing a database that allows to test forest models against a wide range of observational data. This database will be part of a structured model comparison for several forest sites throughout Europe (10-15 forests) to unravel model uncertainties and to provide robust projections of climate change impacts. This model comparison should make use of the wide range of data types that have become available in recent years. We have therefore started compiling data from all kinds of sources in a database. However, in the long-term, the database is envisioned to be not only useful for the model comparison but to develop into a key benchmark dataset for forest models in general.

The database makes also use of data files that you have gratefully provided us with or that we have extracted from data repositories you are involved in. Our aim is to publish the database as part of a ”data paper for harmonized model evaluation” so that whenever a researcher wants to run a model, they could do so using the data as comprehensive test material. The added value of that database is that several data types are brought together (e.g. soil, tree, flux data, satellite and also climate data including scenarios etc...) and the data is harmonized as much as possible and prepared to be ready-to-use for modelers. We do not intend to replace larger database such as ICOS, Euroflux etc. but want provide a product targeted to modelers needs.


## Data policy

The PROFOUND database combines data from existing data sources which are either freely available or available after registration. The added value of the PROFOUND database resides in the combination, harmonization and preparation of the different data types for forest ecosystem modelers. Therefore, the license is for the database while the rights for the individual raw datasets reside with the actual data owners. The PROFOUND database is only redistributing the data.

This work is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 license (CC BY 4.0). You are free to copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format and remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially.

**Attribution** — You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use. Please cite the work as follows: Reyer, CPO et al.

Further data policy statements of the individual datasets contained in the PROFOUND database are listed in the table below.
 


```{r, echo=F, warning = F, message=F}
library(ProfoundData)
setDB("/home/ramiro/ownCloud/PROFOUND_Data/v0.1.13/ProfoundData.sqlite")
#setDB("/home/ramiro/ownCloud/PROFOUND_Data/TESTVERSION/PROFOUNDData.sqlite")
description <- getData("SITEDESCRIPTION")
df <- browseData("POLICY")
df <- df[!df$dataset == "PROFOUND database" , ]
df <- df[!df$dataset == "CLIMATEFLUXNET" , ]
rownames(df) <- NULL
``` 

```{r, echo=F, warning = F, message=F}
pander(df, adding = 0, missing = '**--**', round = 3,
       use.hyphening = TRUE, split.cells = 3, caption = tableCaption("Additional data policy statements specific to the individual datasets included in the PROFOUND database."))
``` 


## SQL Database

The PROFOUND database is a relational SQLite database and it is made of several independent tables (see Fig. 1). From these tables many views are created that can be accessed and downloaded by users. We are also developing a R package to ease the queries of data from the database.


## R package

We have developed a R package to ease the queries of data from the database. 


## Database and package releases

Both package and database are under development. The new database and package relases are published in the [PROFOUND repository](https://github.com/COST-FP1304-PROFOUND/TG2/releases). Users with no Github access are welcome to join the Github repository. 


![`r figCaption("Overview on the PROFOUND database and the R package.") `](../data-raw/ProfoundData.jpg)



# The PROFOUND database

## Site overview
```{r, echo = F, message = F}
df <- getData(dataset = "SITES")
df <- df[, !colnames(df) %in% c("natVegetation_code1" ,	"natVegetation_code2" , "natVegetation_description")]
df <- df[!df$site_id ==99, ]
```

`r paste( "The PROFOUND database includes ", nrow(df), " forest sites. They are listed in the table below.", sep = "") `

```{r, echo = F, message = F}
pander(df, adding = 0, missing = '**--**', round = 3, use.hyphening = TRUE, split.cells = 3, split.tables = 200,
        caption = tableCaption("Forest sites included in the database."))
```

To provide the information on which data is available for each site, an overview table is created by combining all existing tables in the database.

```{r, fig.width= 7, echo = F, message = F}
overview <- browseData()
pander(overview, adding = 0, missing = '**--**', round = 3, use.hyphening = TRUE, split.cells = 3, split.tables =  Inf,
        caption = tableCaption("Overview of sites and datasets"))
```



## Data types


```{r dataTypes, include=FALSE, eval=F}
out <- NULL
childs <- "ChildDatasetSummary.Rmd"
out <- knit_child(childs)
```





## Site by site information

```{r sitesReport, include=FALSE, eval=F}
out <- NULL

for (i in 1:length(overview$site_id)) {
  currentSiteID <- overview$site_id[i]
  currentSiteID <- overview$site_id[i]
  currentSiteName <- overview$site[i]
  currentDescription <- description[description$site ==currentSiteName, ]$description
 out <- c(out, knit_child('ChildSiteSummary.Rmd'))
}
#`r paste(out, collapse='\n')`

```





# References

```{r, echo=F, warning = F, message=F}
df <- getData("SITEDESCRIPTION")
reference <- paste(df$reference, collapse = " ")
reference <- unlist(strsplit(reference, split = "[+]"))
reference <- reference[-1]
reference <- sort(reference, decreasing = FALSE)
reference <- paste("\n +", reference)
``` 
`r paste(reference, collapse="") `
